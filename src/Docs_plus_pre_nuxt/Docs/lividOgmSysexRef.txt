COMMAND DETAILS
02 : Save User Settings

F0 00 01 61 07 02 F7

All User Settings which can be remembered will be stored in Flash and automatically restored whenever the OhmRGB is powered up.

The OhmRGB responds with ACK when finished processing this command.
04 : Set all LED indicators

F0 00 01 61 07 04 B*42 F7

All (81) LED indicators can be set to one of 7 colors or off with this command. There are (42) bytes. Values must be 7F or less. The first 3 bits in a Byte control the R, G, and B values respectively for a single indicator, the next three bits control the RGB for the next LED in the column, and the last bit is ignored. The positions in the list do not conveniently line up with the positions of indicators on the Ohm64.

The LED columns and rows do not conveniently match up with the physical layout of the Button columns and rows. Using codes as C.R to specify column and row, the LED codes are as follows (all codes are decimal in this table):

64 button grid:
56 48 40 32 24 16 8 0
60 52 44 36 28 20 12 4
57 49 41 33 25 17 9 1
61 53 45 37 29 21 13 5
58 50 42 34 26 18 10 2
62 54 46 38 30 22 14 6
59 51 43 35 27 19 11 3
63 55 47 39 31 23 15 7

Left/Right crossfader:
74 75

1-8 Slider 'mute':
66 67 70 71 79 78 77 76

F-buttons:
64 68 72
65 69 73

BPM:
80

The OhmRGB responds with ACK when finished processing this command.
Explanation by way of example:

Each byte controls 2 LEDs. If you set the first byte's value to 0x3F (63) then it would turn the top right button and the button two rows down from it (use the chart in the above link to determine byte "position" and physical location - those are the buttons labeled 0 and 1 in the chart) the color white. If you made the first two bytes value 0x11 and 0x34 the far right column of the RGB Grid would look like:
RED
off
GREEN
off
BLUE
off
CYAN
off

Looked at another way, the byte value 0x11 looks like this in binary, with the first 3 bits controlling the onstate of the RGB leds in the top right button, the next 3 bits the RGB states of the button two down from it:
1 0 0 0 1 0 0
R G B R G B -
so those two buttons will show RED and GREEN respectively
The value 0x34 looks like:
0 0 1 0 1 1 0
R G B R G B -
so those two buttons will be BLUE and GREEN+BLUE (CYAN).

Finally the message would look like this (these are hex values) for the above example:
F0 0 1 61 7 4 11 34 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 F7 and in decimal:
240 0 1 97 7 4 17 52 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 247
05 : Recall User Settings

F0 00 01 61 07 05 F7

Recall User Settings from storage, just like what happens on power up.

The OhmRGB responds with ACK if the User Settings are valid, or NAK when no setting have been saved or the memory is unreadable.
06 : Factory Reset

F0 00 01 61 07 06 F7

This will erase the User Settings so that the OhmRGB is factory fresh.

The OhmRGB responds with ACK when finished processing this command.
07 : Request

F0 00 01 61 07 07 RR .. F7

This command allows several types of information to be requested. Each request type, RR, will be detailed below. Some request messages require additional information bytes to specific which particular item is being requested.

The OhmRGB responds with the specified data.
07.04 : Request all LED indicators

F0 00 01 61 07 07 04 F7

Request state of all LED indicators. The OhmRGB will respond with Command 04, and the bits are interpreted identically.
07.06 : Request Control Surface Snapshot

F0 00 01 61 07 07 06 F7

F0 00 01 61 07 07 09 LL HH F7

Request the current mapping of incoming MIDI messages. LL HH is the 8-bit map code defined under Command 09 below. Both values must not exceed 7F. LL holds the lower 7 bits, HH holds the most significant bit. Values of HH greater than 1 are reserved. The OhmRGB will respond with Command 09, which repeats LL and HH followed by the LED code as CR.
07.0A : Request Analog mapping

F0 00 01 61 07 07 0A F7

Request MIDI map for all Analog inputs. The OhmRGB will respond with Command 0A, and the bits are arranged identically.

Request current bank number. The OhmRGB will respond with

F0 00 01 76 05 1A BANK F7

where BANK is the current bank number 00-03.
07.21 : Request Expansion Jack Map

F0 00 01 61 07 07 22 F7

Request MIDI settings for the expansion jacks. The OhmRGB will respond with Command 21.
07.22 : Request Color Map

F0 00 01 61 07 07 23 F7

08 : MIDI Settings Response

F0 00 01 61 07 08 XX F7

Individual MIDI settings, such as the Channel Mode flags, are combined into the data of this message, XX. Bit 1 is Omni Mode Off/On. Bit 3 is Local Control Off/On. All other bits, including 0 and 2, are Reserved. They may reflect other settings, but they may change in future releases. Note that this is a response command only, and it will be ignored if received by the OhmRGB. Use the official MIDI messages to change these settings.
09 : Map Single LED Indicator

F0 00 01 61 07 09 LL HH CR F7

This command updates the MIDI Input map for a single entry. If HH is 00, then LL specifies the Note number. If HH is 01, then LL specifies the Control number, but only valid control numbers are accepted from 00 to 78. Values of HH above 1 are reserved. CR is the LED indicator Column and Row (see Command 04 for details), or 7F to clear the mapping for the specified entry.

The OhmRGB responds with a Single MIDI Input mapping for the specified message.
0A : Map Analog Inputs

F0 00 01 61 07 0A (25)*[LL HH] F7

This command updates the MIDI map for all (25) Analog inputs. If HH is 00, then LL specifies the 7-bit Control number, but only valid control numbers 00 to 78 are accepted. If HH is 01, then LL selects between 14-bit Control numbers and Pitch Bend. In the latter case, LL between 60 and 6F specifies a Pitch Bend message on Channel (1) through (16), respectively. Otherwise, LL selects a 14-bit Control number, of which the only valid control numbers are 00 to 1F. All other values for LL, 20 through 5F and 70 through 7F are reserved for future use. Values of HH above 1 are similarly reserved.

There are (25) sets of LL HH value pairs in this message, each corresponding to the index of an Analog input. These indices do not conveniently match up with the physical layout. The index codes are arranged as follows (all indices are decimal in this table, and start with 0):

crossfader: 24 eight faders, from left to right: 23, 22, 15, 14, 5, 7, 6, 4 upper left knobs: 17, 16, 9, 8 19, 18, 11, 10 21, 20, 13, 12 right knobs: 3, 1, 0, 2

The OhmRGB responds with ACK when finished processing this command.
0B : Map Buttons

F0 00 01 61 07 0B (88)*[LL HH] F7

This command updates the MIDI map for all (81) Buttons. If HH is 00, then LL specifies the Note number. If HH is 01, then LL specifies the Control number, but only valid control numbers are accepted from 00 to 78. Larger values of LL and HH are reserved, with 7A (start), 7B (continue), and 7C (stop) used for MMC, 7E is used for bank cycling. Bank cycling will allow a button to cycle through the bank programs 1-4 and change the color of the LED to indicate the current bank:

    1=white
    2=red
    3=green
    4=blue

There are (88) sets of LL HH value pairs in this message, each corresponding to the index of a Button. These indices do not conveniently match up with the physical layout, and there are seven missing codes near the end which are reserved. The index codes are arranged as follows (all indices are decimal in this table, and start with 0):

grid buttons are:
0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56
1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57
2, 10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58
3, 11, 19, 27, 35, 43, 51, 59
4, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60
5, 13, 21, 29, 37, 45, 53, 61
6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, 54, 62
7, 15, 23, 31, 39, 47, 55, 63

crossfader
64, 72

1-8 Slider 'mute' buttons, from left to right, are:
65, 73, 66, 74, 67, 75, 68, 76

function 1-6:
77, 78, 79, 69, 70, 71

BPM:
87

The OhmRGB responds with ACK when finished processing this command.
0C : Set MIDI Basic Channel

F0 00 01 61 07 0C NN F7

This command sets the MIDI Basic Channel to NN, where 00 through 0F are valid and the rest are reserved. During operation, incoming Channel messages are ignored if Omni Mode is Off and the Channel does not match. If Omni Mode in On, then the incoming Channel is not checked, and all messages are interpreted. For outgoing MIDI messages, the Basic Channel is always used unless an Analog input is mapped to Pitch Bend, in which case the Channel number is specified by the mapping entry.

The OhmRGB responds with ACK when finished processing this command.
0D : Set MIDI Output Merge

F0 00 01 61 07 0D NN F7

This command allows the Control Surface to merge its messages onto the MIDI output jack, in addition to USB. NN can be 00 (off) or 01 (on). Other values are reserved.

The OhmRGB responds with ACK when finished processing this command.
0E : Erase entire MIDI Input Map

F0 00 01 61 07 0E F7

This command erases all MIDI Input message mappings. These affect the remote control of LED indicators, so no remote control will be available immediately after the map is erased. Because there are as many as (256) possible MIDI Input messages that can be mapped to an LED, and because multiple assignments to the same LED can cause conflicts, it is best to start the LED indicator mapping process by first erasing all entries before filling in the desired mappings, no more than (75), preferably.

The OhmRGB responds with ACK when finished processing this command.
0F : Set crossfader Flip (left or right as minimum)

F0 00 01 61 07 0F NN F7

This command allows the crossfader response to be flipped. NN can be 00 or 01. Other values are reserved.

The OhmRGB responds with ACK when finished processing this command.
16: Set Bank Channel

F0 00 01 76 05 16 CH F7

This command will set the input and output channel for all controls in the current bank. CH specifies the channel, in the range of 0-0F. This does not change the controller's Main channel, which is used for communicating with the device for program changes, and other standard MIDI commands.
17: Set All Bank Channels

F0 00 01 76 05 17 CH*4 F7

This command will set the input and output channel for all controls in all (4) program banks. CH specifies the channel, in the range of 0-0F. This does not change the controller's Main channel, which is used for communicating with the device for program changes, and other standard MIDI commands.
18: Save Current Bank Settings

F0 00 01 76 05 18 F7

This command will save all settings to flash memory for the current bank.
19: Save All Bank Settings

F0 00 01 76 05 19 F7

This command will save all banks to flash memory.
1A: Current Bank

F0 00 01 76 05 1A BANK F7

Contains the Bank number in the BANK byte. This message is sent in response to 07 1A in addition to a bank button press on the controller.
21 : Map Expansion Analog Inputs

F0 00 01 61 07 21 (10)*[LL HH] F7

This command updates the MIDI map for all (10) Expansion Analog inputs. If HH is 00, then LL specifies the 7-bit Control number, but only valid control numbers 00 to 78 are accepted. If HH is 01, then LL selects between 14-bit Control numbers and Pitch Bend. In the latter case, LL between 60 and 6F specifies a Pitch Bend message on Channel (1) through (16), respectively. Otherwise, LL selects a 14-bit Control number, of which the only valid control numbers are 00 to 1F. All other values for LL, 20 through 5F and 70 through 7F are reserved for future use. Values of HH above 1 are similarly reserved.

There are (10) sets of LL HH value pairs in this message, each corresponding to the index of an Analog input. The relationship of LL HH pairs (called "BB" below) to the physical pins on the expansion jack are like so:
Exp-bytes.png
The OhmRGB responds with ACK when finished processing this command.
22 : Color Map

F0 00 01 61 07 22 (7)*[COLOR CODE] F7

The color values that are triggered by note velocity and cc value can be changed. The COLOR CODES are:

    0 -> No Color (LED Off)
    0x01 (100) -> Red
    0x02 (010) -> Green
    0x03 (110) -> Yellow (Red+Green)
    0x04 (001) -> Blue
    0x05 (101) -> Magenta (Red+Blue)
    0x06 (011) -> Cyan (Blue+Green)
    0x07 (111) -> White (Red+Blue+Green)

Looked at another way, the color value in any of the 7 slots will match up with the following velocities:
0 	1 	2 	3 	4 	5 	6 	7
0 	1-3 	4-7 	8-15 	16-31 	32-63 	64-126 	127

currently, the default is 0 7 6 5 1 4 3 2:

    000-000: OFF
    001-003: White
    004-007: Cyan
    008-015: Magenta
    016-031: Red
    032-063: Blue
    064-126: Yellow
    127-127: Green

23 : Map LED All Notes

F0 00 01 61 07 23 (128)*[CR CODE] F7 Command 23 is an alternative to Command 09. The position index of the (128) bytes represent a note number, and the byte value represents the CR Code (see CR Code map). For example, the CR Code (80) in position 0 would map note 0 to the Livid Logo button. A CR Code of (127) in any position in the 128 byte list means that the note at that position will not control any LED.
24 Map LED All CCs

F0 00 01 61 07 24 (128)*[CR CODE] F7 Command 24 is an alternative to Command 09. The position index of the (128) bytes represent a continuous controller number, and the byte value represents the CR Code (see CR Code map). For example, the CR Code (80) in position 0 would map cc 0 to the Livid Logo button LED. A CR Code of (127) in any position in the 128 byte list means that the cc at that position will not control any LED.
25 : Set All LEDs For All Banks

F0 00 01 61 07 25 (B1*42) (B2*42) (B3*42) (B4*42) F7

Similar to Command 04, this will change the LED states for all banks. The result is that any stored LED settings in a bank will be overwritten by the states described in Command 25. The (42) bytes B1 will describe the states for bank 01, the (42) bytes B2 will describe the states for bank 02, and so on. It is worth noting that these settings will not be saved to flash memory, however, unless a Command 18 or 19 is send to the device.
7E : NAK Negative Acknowledge

F0 00 01 61 07 7E F7

This is intended as a way for the OhmRGB to indicate a problem with the previous message. Unfortunately, when messages are sent too fast, it becomes impossible for the OhmRGB to reply with anything reliably, even NAK.

The best approach is to wait for ACK (see below) after sending each message, rather than depend on NAK to indicate an error. The one exception is Recall User Settings, where the OhmRGB will reply with NAK if the contents of User memory are empty or otherwise corrupted.
7F : ACK Positive Acknowledge

F0 00 01 61 07 7F F7

ACK means the previous message was handled correctly. Some messages (e.g. Map Single LED Indicator) simply reply with a specific command instead of ACK, when more context is needed than a simple acknowledgment.
